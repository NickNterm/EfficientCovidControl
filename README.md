This Project was made for Vodafone Generation Next competition by Ilias Paschopoulos, Giannis Paschopoulos, Nikolas Ntermaris. The main idea for the project is a device that can check if someone is wearing a mask and at the same time measure his temperature. With this device a company for example can be sure if everyone maintain the protection measures.
